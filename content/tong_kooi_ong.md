comment: Datuk Tong has performed well as an ND and was actively engaged by Khazanah’s Internal Nominee Directors and the senior management of M+S. He has good working relationship with the M&M team. As the Chairman of the Development & Marketing Coordinating Committee, he provided useful guidance in relation to marketing and developmental aspects of Marina One and DUO projects. Further, he also provided valuable steer for the company in managing the negotiations with HDGS (main contractor of Marina One) over disputes. Datuk Tong has a strong understanding of property sector, and coupled with his business acumen and experience across multiple sectors performs his role very well. On occasions when we don’t agree on something, we have had constructive pre-board discussions. He is a role model for Khazanah NDs.
